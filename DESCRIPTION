Description: This is a shape preserving spline which is guaranteed to be monotonic and concave\convex
    if the data has these properties. It does not use any optimisation and is therefore quick and 
    smoothly converges to a fixed point in economic dynamics problems including value function iteration.
    It is the spline recommended for dynamic programming problems in Ljungqvist & Sargent's Recursive Macroeconomic
     Theory and Judd's Numerical Methods in Economics. It has been modified from the presentation in Judd to also
     give the first two derivatives of the spline and to be more flexible in determining behaviour when evaluated
    outside the domain.

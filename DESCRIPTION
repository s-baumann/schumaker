Description: This is a shape preserving spline which is guaranteed 
    to be monotonic and concave or convex if the data is monotonic 
    and concave or convex. It is the spline recommended for 
    dynamic programming problems in Ljungqvist & Sargent's 
    Recursive Macroeconomic Theory and Judd's Numerical Methods in 
    Economics. It does not use any optimisation and is therefore 
    quick and smoothly converges to a fixed point in economic 
    dynamics problems including value function iteration. It has 
    been modified from the presentation in Judd to also give the 
    first two derivatives of the spline and to be more flexible in 
    determining behaviour when evaluated outside the domain.
